'''
Chef has an integer N and he wants to generate a matrix M with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and N columns (numbered 1 through N). He thinks that M would be delicious if:

Each element of this matrix is an integer between 1 and N2 inclusive.
All the elements of the matrix are pairwise distinct.
For each square submatrix containing cells in rows r through r+a and in columns c through c+a (inclusive) for some valid integers r, c and aâ‰¥0:
Mr,c+Mr+a,c+a is even
Mr,c+a+Mr+a,c is even
Can you help Chef generate a delicious matrix? It can be proved that a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
